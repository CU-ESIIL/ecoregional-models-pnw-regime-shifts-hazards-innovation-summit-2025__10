# Data Access â€” PNW Regime Shift Hazards

Use this page to document datasets feeding the Ecoregional Models project. Capture:

- **Source & link:** catalog entry, DOI, or repository URL.
- **Access notes:** credentials, request steps, or file size expectations.
- **Usage:** how the dataset informs hazard identification across Pacific Northwest ecoregions.

Add sections such as `## Core datasets`, `## Supplemental context`, and `## Derived products` as our work progresses.
